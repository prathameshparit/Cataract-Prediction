# Cataract-Prediction
This is a machine learning project for predicting the presence of cataracts in eye images. The project is built using Flask web framework and is deployed as a web application.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains a total of 1628 eye images, with 804 images showing cataracts and 824 images without cataracts.

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the dataset to predict the presence of cataracts in eye images.

## Flask Web Application
The Flask web application allows users to upload an eye image and receive a prediction of the presence of cataracts. The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
